	The output is as follows.
        [user34@NDAUnix ~]$ ls chap*
        chap1  chap2

8.Give appropriate command to create a directory called C_prog under your home directory. (Note: Check the directory using ls)
sol:mkdir c_prog
	The output is as follows.
	[user34@NDAUnix ~]$ pwd
	/home/user34
	[user34@NDAUnix ~]$ mkdir c_prog
	[user34@NDAUnix ~]$ cd c_prog
	[user34@NDAUnix c_prog]$ pwd
	/home/user34/c_prog
	[user34@NDAUnix c_prog]$

9.Create the following directories under your home directory. (Note: Check using ls)
newdir
newdirectory
sol:mkdir newdir
    mkdir newdirectory
	The output is as follows.
	[user34@NDAUnix saranya_67]$ ls
        file1  file2  file3  lsoutput  newdir  newdirectory  nrefile  output


10.List the names of all the files, including the contents of the sub directories under your home directory.

22.	List the contents of first.unix and first.unics with a single command.
23.	Create a new directory under the temp directory.
24.	From your home directory, copy all the files to the directory created under the temp sub directory.
25.	Move the file first.unix to the directory temp as second.unix 
26.	Remove the file called first.unics from the home directory.

28.	Move all files whose names end with a, c and o to the HOME directory.
29.	Copy all files that end with a ‘UNIX’ to the temp directory.
30.	Issuing a single command, remove all the files from the directory temp and the directory itself.
31.	Try commands cp and mv with invalid number of arguments and note the results.
